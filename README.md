smartspaces-client
==================

The client-side resources (HTML, JS and CSS) of the Smart Spaces experience.  In other words, a webpage like this: [smartspac.es/notman](http://smartspac.es/notman)

Installation
------------

1. Clone the repo

Configuration
-------------

You shouldn't have to touch anything.  All of the configuration happens server-side in [smartspaces-server](https://github.com/reelyactive/smartspaces-server).

The default configuration expects smartspaces-server to reside in a neighbouring folder.  This can be achieved by cloning the [smartspaces-server](https://github.com/reelyactive/smartspaces-server) repository from the same root folder.

Running locally
---------------

As simple as browsing a website (see [smartspaces-server](https://github.com/reelyactive/smartspaces-server)).
